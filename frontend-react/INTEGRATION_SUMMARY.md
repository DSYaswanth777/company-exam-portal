- `GET /api/company/drives/{driveId}/questions` - List questions
- `POST /api/company/drives/{driveId}/questions` - Add question
- `GET /api/company/colleges` - List available colleges
- `GET /api/company/student-groups` - List student groups

### 4. API Configuration ✅

**File:** `src/lib/companyApi.js`

Comprehensive API endpoints configuration matching the backend:

- Authentication endpoints

- Company operations endpoints
- Question and student management
- Email template management
- Reference data endpoints (colleges, student groups)

### 5. Design & Styling

**Preserved:** All Tailwind CSS styling from the existing React frontend

- Modern gradient buttons (red/orange for admin, blue/purple for company)
- Dark mode support
- Responsive grid layouts
- Modal dialogs for additional actions
- Status badges with color coding
- Form validation with error messages
- Loading states and spinners
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Key Features Ported from HTML Frontend

### Admin Features

✅ Company registration approval workflow
✅ Drive approval and rejection
✅ Drive suspension and reactivation
✅ Company status filtering
✅ View company drives and enrolled students
✅ College and student group management
✅ Pending approvals management

### Company Features

✅ Drive creation with detailed configuration
✅ Target audience selection (colleges, student groups, batch years)
✅ Custom college and group creation (pending admin approval)
✅ Question management (add, edit, view)
✅ Student enrollment via CSV upload
✅ Drive submission for approval
✅ Drive status tracking
✅ Email template management and sending
✅ Drive duplication for reuse

## API Integration Points

### Base URL Configuration

- Development: Uses relative `/api` path (proxied through Vite)
- Proper axios interceptors for token management
- Automatic error handling and 401 redirect

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in (admin/company)
2. Backend returns JWT access token
3. Token stored in localStorage with user type
4. Token automatically attached to all subsequent requests
5. On logout, token cleared and user redirected to home

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages from backend displayed via toast
- Failed requests show detail from backend response
- 401 Unauthorized automatically logs user out
- Form validation errors displayed inline and as toasts

## Testing Recommendations

### Admin Login Test

```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Expected: Redirect to admin dashboard
```

### Company Registration Test

```
Company Name: Test Corp
Username: testcorp
Email: test@testcorp.com
Password: password123
Expected: Success message, redirect to company login after 1.2s
```

### Company Login Test

```
Username: (any registered company username)
Password: (registered password)
Expected: Redirect to company dashboard
```

## Notes for Backend Integration

### CORS Configuration

Ensure backend has CORS enabled for frontend domain:

```python
allowed_origins = ["http://localhost:5300", "http://localhost:3000", "your-production-domain"]
```

### API Response Format

Backend endpoints return data in expected format:

- Success responses include data payload
- Error responses include `detail` field with error message
- Auth endpoints return `access_token` and `token_type`

### Token Claims

Backend's JWT includes:

- `sub`: User ID
- `user_type`: "admin" or "company"
- `exp`: Expiration time

Frontend decodes these for client-side checks if needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Testing**: Ensure all backend endpoints are working correctly
2. **API Base URL**: Configure proper base URL for production
3. **CORS Setup**: Configure backend CORS for frontend domain
4. **Database Seeding**: Add sample data if needed
5. **Email Configuration**: Configure email settings in backend (if not done)
6. **File Upload**: If CSV upload is needed, verify multipart/form-data handling

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All frontend functionality from the HTML/CSS/JS version has been successfully integrated into the React application while maintaining design consistency and adding proper state management.
